## Hi there üëã

I'm Klest Dedja, a PhD graduate in **Explainable AI**, specialized in **Survival Analysis**.
My research at KULeuven-KULAK, under the supervision of Prof. [Celine Vens](https://kulak.kuleuven.be/~celine.vens/index.html) has been focused on making models interpretable and trustworthy for critical decision-making, especially in high-stakes setting such as healthcare.
I have explored **Random Forests** extensively, as their inherent structure provides both flexibility in predictive modeling and potential pathways to interpretability.

### üî≠ Current Projects
- I am currently working at **[Predikt](https://predikt.ai/)**, a young, innovative start-up dedicated to advancing **time-series forecasting** for CFOs and finance leaders. We are developing AI-driven tools that bring confidence and trust to forecasting processes, helping finance teams make more informed, data-backed decisions.

  Interested in learning more about our product? Then you should definitley reach out to our CEO **[Nick Vandesype](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickvandesype/)** on LinkedIn.

- If coding in my free time (erm... not very often), I am most likely maintaining and evolving a project from my PhD years, namely **[BELLATREX](https://github.com/klest94/bellatrex)**: an open-access [pip package](https://pypi.org/project/bellatrex/) designed to support adoption and transparency of **Random Forest** models for several prediction tasks: binary classification, regression, survival-analysis, multi-lablel classification, and multi-target regression.

  Do you like BELLATREX? I am looking to collaborate with researchers or practitioners to make BELLATREX better! If you have fresh ideas, feature requests, or are interested in contributing to new functionalities, I‚Äôd love to connect üòä.
   Keep an eye on the repository and don't forget to add a ‚≠êÔ∏è

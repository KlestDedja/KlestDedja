## Hi there üëã

I'm Klest Dedja

Passionate about mathematics, my background bridges **Applied Mathematics** and **Machine Learning**.
During my PhD at **KULeuven**  under the supervision of Prof. [Celine Vens](https://kulak.kuleuven.be/~celine.vens/index.html) I specialized **Explainable AI** for **Survival Analysis** tasks (time-to-event in the presence of partial information) with applications in healthcare (Multiple Sclerosis, kidney function, etc.).
I have explored **Random Forests** extensively, as their inherent structure provides both flexibility in predictive modeling and potential pathways to interpretability.

Additionally, I explored the intersection of **Active Learning** and **Survival Analysis**, with findings and tested approaches shown in this little [project](https://github.com/Klest94/AL-SA-paper-material). You can find my PhD dissertation [here](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/dff3deaa-efd3-45e2-833c-e6db47d88434).

The combination of deep theoretical expertise in AI related fields, paired with 7+ years of programming has made me a strong and curious Data Scientist (assuming we agree on the meaning of this term).

### üè≠ Industry experience:
- I have worked at **[Predikt](https://predikt.ai/)**, a young, innovative start-up dedicated to advancing **time-series forecasting** for CFOs and finance leaders. Predikt is developing AI-driven tools that bring confidence and trust to forecasting processes, helping CFOs and finance leaders make more informed, data-backed decisions.

### üî≠ Current Projects

- I am maintaining a project from my PhD years, namely **[BELLATREX](https://github.com/klest94/bellatrex)**: an open-access [package](https://pypi.org/project/bellatrex/) designed to support adoption and transparency of **Random Forest** models for several prediction tasks: binary classification, regression, survival-analysis, multi-lablel classification, and multi-target regression.

  Do you like BELLATREX? I am looking for collaborators to make BELLATREX better! If you have fresh ideas, feature requests, or are interested in contributing to new functionalities, I‚Äôd love to connect üòä.
   Keep an eye on the repository and don't forget to add a ‚≠êÔ∏è

- Another project of my PhD years involves extending [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) explanatory toolbox to time-to-event data, with a focus on explaining feature importance within a given interval of time. This work is a fast and lean alternative to [SurvSHAP(t)](https://github.com/MI2DataLab/survshap).

- To be released to the public once the related paper is accepted: [EDGEHOG](https://github.com/Klest94/directionality), a tool for **automatic directionality dispersion** estimate, using some old school **Computer vision** approach
